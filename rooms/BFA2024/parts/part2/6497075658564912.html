                    <p>“May balance guide my way.” Opening your eyes from meditation, you can easily tell that the trees are different. The Gates hum in agreement as you pass through, their ancient voices fading into the wind. Ahead, a tunnel of frost-laden branches shimmers faintly with the remnants of Keeper magic. The air grows lighter and frost recedes slightly. You pause to breathe in the faint scent of earth and sap beneath the chill. But the tremors beneath your feet urge you forward into the tunnel; there is no time to linger in this moment.</p>
                    <p>The path widens into an alcove of withering trees, their leaves falling like shards of brittle glass. The ground is littered with jagged roots and patches of glowing moss. The trees seem to call to you in grief. Your fingers brush against the icy bark of the trees, and you feel the echo of the Keepers’ presence. This is their work, long abandoned: the delicate mending of the Grove. The trees demand your hands to remove their scars, to carve a path forward by shedding their burdens.</p>
