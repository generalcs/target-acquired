                <h1>Keeper</h1>
                <p>With trembling hands, you press the seeds into the soft earth surrounding the Tree of Life. As the last seed vanishes beneath the soil, the Grove quakes with a sudden pulse of energy. The fractures in the tree’s trunk begin to knit together, golden light seeping through the seams like molten fire. A radiant glow cascades up the bark. Blossoms unfurl in a symphony of colors. Warmth floods the Grove, melting away the frost and breathing life into the surrounding trees. In the distance, the silhouettes of countless worlds flicker into balance.</p>
                <p>You rise slowly. A soft breeze brushes through the Grove, and it weaves deep into your chest. As you gaze down, you notice faint patterns etched across your skin—intricate veins like those of leaves, glowing softly with magic. The bark of the Tree of Life feels familiar beneath your fingertips, as if it recognizes you. You try to move, but your legs seem to be rooted in place. The Grove whispers. Its voice is no longer mournful.</p>
