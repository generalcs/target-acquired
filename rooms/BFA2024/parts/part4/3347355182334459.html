                <div>
                    <p>The air thickens with an ancient presence, and the faint shimmer of Keeper magic hums in your ears. You stop at the edge of a clearing where the trees stand taller. Faint carvings of eyes and mouths adorn their bark. These are no ordinary treesâ€”these are hamadryads. You kneel and press your palm to the earth, whispering a plea for guidance. At first, silence answers. Then, with a rustling of leaves and groaning roots, the hamadryads stir. Their voices are low and mournful as they guide you.</p>
                    <p>They lead you to the heart of the Grove. The frost has retreated entirely, leaving a sacred expanse of vibrant moss and golden light. In the center stands the Tree of Life. Its once-glorious canopy has been reduced to dying branches, and its trunk is heavily fractured. Magic lingers here, but it clings desperately to what little remains. At the base of the tree, nestled in a hollow, lie the seeds of life. The hamadryads fade back into the woods, leaving you alone with the task. You must plant and nurture these seeds to reconstruct the tree. You kneel by the hollow, the warmth of the seeds filling your hands.</p>
