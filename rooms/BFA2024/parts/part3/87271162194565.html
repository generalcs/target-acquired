                    <p>You take a deep breath and draw the blade from your side. Its edge glints faintly with a pale green light. The trees around you seem to sigh, their grief-laden whispers softening as you begin your work. You deadhead the withered branches and frostbitten blooms, cutting away the burden so new life can stir. As though the trees themselves are thanking you, the brittle air shifts to carry a warmer breeze.</p>
                    <p>The frost underfoot thins. Patches of soft moss cushion your steps. You can feel the faintest warmth radiating from somewhere deep within the Grove. As you press on, the ground begins to slope downward, revealing two intertwining paths ahead. Each is marked with faint symbols etched into the glowing mossâ€”a spiral to the left and a jagged line to the right. You kneel to examine the markings, and realize that choosing incorrectly may mean getting lost in Limbo forever. Which path will guide you closer to the center of the Grove?</p>
