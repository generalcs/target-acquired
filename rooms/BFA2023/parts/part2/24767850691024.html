                    <p>You descend to Durand’s second floor with haste; one more floor towards an opportunity for escape. As you walk out the microkitchen area, your arm is suddenly grabbed from behind the corner. You turn your head slowly to the left, ready to accept your final destiny. It was inevitable for your plans to fail given the section leaders’ propensity for serving students at LaIR.</p>
                    <p>But perhaps your time may not come to an end quite yet - it’s your beloved section leader! “S-section prob-blem,” they manage to stutter in their zombie form. In their left hand, they hold their laptop with Paperless raring to go. In their right hand, a section handout containing one problem. You decide you have no choice and take the section handout in efforts to stave off your own section leader.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, it might take a while. The handout requests that you recite your answer to this backtracking problem out loud.</p>
