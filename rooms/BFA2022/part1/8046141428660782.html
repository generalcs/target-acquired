                <div>
                    <p>&emsp;The private network company gave you access to traffic statistics and scanners, but you don’t have any access to the network itself. You need another way to get direct access to the network - through the physical bank system. Each bank’s headquarters should store physical copies of their virtual passwords and codes in their vaults. Your team hops in the car and drives over to the nearest headquarters for one of the 5 national bank chains.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;You rush over to the front desk of the building, explaining the dire situation and shoving identification onto the counter. Fortunately, the receptionist authenticates you for the bank’s info vault, giving you the code for the safe. But he leads with a disclaimer: “Fred is reprogramming the safe software and just pushed some fatally buggy code on Friday evening. The vault hasn’t been opening for two days now, but he’ll be back tomorrow to fix it.” Without time to ping the oncall team or be appalled at Fred’s software engineering practices, your team downloads the source code for the vault and begins debugging.</p>
