                        <h4>Topic: Linked Lists</h4>
                        <p>You work for a third-party security agency that intercepts digital attacks across the country. Recently, a company that installs private computer networks has contacted your agency to monitor access around key nodes. Each of these key nodes allow access to large webs of the network, and given the right password, admin permissions. You and a group of three co-workers have been assigned to scan for unusual traffic.</p>
                        <p>Upon arriving to your office in New York City, you notice a warning bar flashing across your work computer. Your partners quickly glance over your screen and turn back to focus on their own computers. With as many false alarms as there have been in the past couple of months, you take your time grabbing a coffee in the office microkitchen before sitting down. However, once seated, you instantly realize you haven’t seen any warning message like this before - “UNKNOWN ACCESS to Key Node id BA2F4”. Thousands of UNKNOWN ACCESS warnings pop up when you click into the message.</p>
                        <p>Hackers have breached the network, but they haven’t cracked admin permissions yet. You yell to your co-workers and quickly create an action plan. Eliminating unauthorized access will take some time, but your team estimates that the hackers will succeed within 1 hour. To your demise, this network manages 5 major bank chains across the nation. With admin permissions, hackers can do whatever they wish with each bank’s records and transactions. Can you eliminate them before the U.S. economy collapses?</p>
