                    <p>&emsp;Time is ticking; only half an hour left before the hackers get admin privileges. You have a general idea of the breached nodes, but you need to shut down those nodes remotely from your connection. However, your signal is suddenly interrupted as the network floods with useless packets. The attackers must have seen that you deactivated their pipelines, and now your team is prevented from communicating with any node without filtering out the cacophony.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;From what you can tell, the useless packets only contain characters within the range of ASCII 100 and 109. Filtering these packets will help establish a stable connection between you and every node in the network. You donâ€™t have much time left, but this is the only way to regain access within the system.</p>
